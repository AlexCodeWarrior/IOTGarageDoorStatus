# IOTGarageDoorStatus

Goal: Get status of the garage door 

MATERIALS: 
 * ESP2866 Board 
 * Blynk App 
 * Blynk Arduino Library 
 * Magnetic Switch Sensor 
 * Bread Board 
 * L.E.D ( visual representation) 
 
 First Step: 
  * Get the Blynk App in phone  
  * Create Blynk Project ( Use Authentication token later) 
  * Add Wigets to Project 
  
  In the Sparkfun link they have a great tutorial on how to create project and get Blynk Arduino Library

  Widgets needed: 
  
   * Value Display - Display the value of the door state 
   * Eventor - ( will be link to Value display ) to relate pin state to door status ( open/close) 
   * Button -  turn off / on LED   which will be connected to GP13 
    
    Note: Magnetic Switch set up when swith is closed is state will be equal to 0 ;
